{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
-- | Actors perceiving other actors and the dungeon level.
--
-- Visibility works according to KISS. Everything that player sees is real.
-- There are no unmarked hidden tiles and only solid tiles can be marked,
-- so there are no invisible walls and to pass through an illusory wall,
-- you have to use a turn bumping into it first. Only tiles marked with Suspect
-- can turn out to be another tile. (So, if all tiles are marked with
-- Suspect, the player knows nothing for sure, but this should be avoided,
-- because searching becomes too time-consuming.)
-- Each actor sees adjacent tiles, even when blind, so adjacent tiles are
-- known, so the actor can decide accurately whether to pass thorugh
-- or alter, etc.
--
-- Items are always real and visible. Actors are real, but can be invisible.
-- Invisible actors in walls can't be hit, but are hinted at when altering
-- the tile, so the player can flee or block. Invisible actors in open
-- space can be hit.

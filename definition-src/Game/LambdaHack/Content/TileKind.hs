-- of the absence of a corresponding type @Tile@ that would hold
-- particular concrete tiles in the dungeon.
-- Note that tile names (and any other content names) should not be plural
-- (that would lead to "a stairs"), so "road with cobblestones" is fine,
-- but "granite cobblestones" is wrong.
--
-- Tile kind for unknown space has the minimal @ContentId@ index.
-- The @talter@ for unknown space is @1@ and no other tile kind has that value.

-- can't himself tell from other places, and so running does not confer
-- any advantages, except UI convenience. Hashes are accurate enough

In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair (aiming crosshair).
Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait, bracing for impact, which reduces any
damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press `C-KP_5` (the same key
with Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn, without bracing and `S-KP_5` (with Shift)
to yell/yawn, taunting and waking up enemies/yourself. You displace enemies
by running into them with Shift/Control or RMB. Search, open, descend and
attack by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies. The best melee weapon
is automatically chosen from your equipment and from among your body parts.

Walk throughout a level with mouse or numeric keypad (right diagram below)
or the Vi editor keys (middle) or the left hand movement keys (left).
Run until disturbed with Shift or Control. Go-to with LMB (left mouse button).
Run collectively via S-LMB (holding Shift).

In aiming mode, the same keys (and mouse) move the x-hair (aiming crosshair).
Press `KP_5` (`5` on keypad) to wait, bracing for impact, which reduces any
damage taken and prevents displacement by foes. Press `S-KP_5` or `C-KP_5`
(the same key with Shift or Control) to lurk 0.1 of a turn, without bracing.
Displace enemies by running into them with Shift/Control or S-LMB. Search,
open, descend and attack by bumping into walls, doors, stairs and enemies.
The best melee weapon is automatically chosen from your equipment
and from among your body parts.
